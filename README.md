# Image-processing
Hello everyone! Myself Akshay Puthiya Valappil, a final year CSE student at Vimal Jyothi Engineering College. 
I chose this course because of my passion to technologies and also because of the job scope underlying in this technolgy sector.
Apart from these, I'm more interested in planes and cars and kind of am an aviation enthusiast. 
One important fact about me is that I always try to achieve things that I'm more interested with full dedication and I'm good at facing hurdles and thriving through them.
Thankyou!
Here what we are doing is we are creating  a system which can classify fruits and vegetables to deiseased and halthy category based on their pictures using image processing technology.
We built this by creating a web application where users can login and upload pictures of the fruits they intend to buy and the system produces the corresponding output.
Through this technology we can expand and develop the current diseased and healthy classification process, which is manually done by people and promote a healthier community.
